<h2><a id="Specification_21"></a>Specification</h2>

<h3><a id="Web_Architecture_22"></a>Web Architecture</h3>

<img src="../assets/images/architecture.png" />
<p>The APIs return JSONs. In this way the client side the html pages send one or more requests to the server, which will respond by sending JSON files; the HTML page will therefore base its content (writings, images, etc.) on what will be written on this file</p>

<h3><a id="API_25"></a>API</h3>

<h4><a id="REST_compliance_26"></a>REST compliance</h4>

<p> The backend implementation follows REST principle at 100%.<br>
    We opted for a model where data is returned as a jsonArray containing jsonObjects. <br>
    The reason behind this decision is that every endpoint ALWAYS return what is expected or, <br>
    as per specification, an appropriate error. We decided to avoid big request with large amount of <br>
    data and informations to adhere to the principle that simple is, not always but often, better. <br>
    So for example if /books/?isBestSeller={value} is called, the API user know that it will always produce <br>
    an array of books, or an array of error and he can check (and should definitely do it) the content of the response beforehand just by looking at the response code. <br>
    Thus, using a more elaborated model based on jsonObject containing jsonProperty and JsonArray (like twitter API for example),<br>
    was not needed and in general it would have been an overkill. <br>

<h4><a id="OpenAPI_Resource_models_30"></a>OpenAPI Resource models</h4>
<p>Describe here synthetically, which models you have introduced for resources.</p>

<h3><a id="Data_model_32"></a>Data model</h3>

<img src="../assets/images/IDM-Tables.jpg" width="906.75" height="915" />
<p><b>How these map to the OpenAPI data model?</b></p>
<p>Through a middleware (knex) we create JSON files based on the database content. This JSON files will be the ones that the open API wil send to the client<br><br><br></p>

<h2><a id="Implementation_35"></a>Implementation</h2>

<h3><a id="Tools_used_36"></a>Tools used</h3>

  <p>Describe here which tools, languages and frameworks did you use for the backend<br>
    of the application.</p>

<h3><a id="Discussion_39"></a>Discussion</h3>

<p>Describe here:</p><br>
<ul>
    <li>How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided OpenAPI<br>
        specification?
    </li>
    <li>Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to partition<br>
        the web application (static assets vs. application data)
    </li>
    <li>Describe synthetically why and how did you manage session state, what are the<br>
        state change triggering actions (e.g., POST to login etc…).
    </li>
    <li>Which technology did you use (relational or a no-SQL database) for managing<br>
        the data model?
    </li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="Task_assignment_50"></a>Task assignment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Alessandro worked principally on Front end part (HTML Page creation, CSS specification and some JS files)</li>
    <li>Sergio worked principally on server creation and OpenAPI Spec</li>
    <li>Federico worked both in Front End and Back part (ajax request to server, router path creation, some css modification, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="Analysis_of_existing_API_55"></a>Analysis of existing API</h3>
<p>Describe here if you have found relevant APIs that have inspired the OpenAPI<br>
    specification and why (at least two).</p>

<h3><a id="Learning_outcome_58"></a>Learning outcome</h3>
<p>What was the most important thing all the members have learned while developing<br>
    this part of the project, what questions remained unanswered, how you will use<br>
    what you’ve learned in your everyday life?<br>
    Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Foo learned to write SQL queries and Javascript but wanted to know more about<br>
        caching, he’s probably going to create his own startup with what she has<br>
        learned
    </li>
    <li>Bar learned how to deploy on a cloud platform, he would have liked to know<br>
        more about promises for asynchronous code…
    </li>
</ul>

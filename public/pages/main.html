<h2><a id="Specification_21"></a>Specification</h2>

<h3><a id="Web_Architecture_22"></a>Web Architecture</h3>

<img src="../assets/images/architecture.png" />
<p>The APIs return JSONs. In this way the client side the html pages send one or more requests to the server, which will respond by sending JSON files; the HTML page will therefore base its content (writings, images, etc.) on what will be written on this file</p>

<h3><a id="API_25"></a>API</h3>

<h4><a id="REST_compliance_26"></a>REST compliance</h4>

<p> The backend implementation follows REST principle, however we used a cookie login to guarantee<br>
    session's persistent and this is something that in general breaks REST principle <br>
    of statelessness but we thought that a stateless API key login would be inappropriate<br>
    We opted for a model where data is returned as a jsonArray containing jsonObjects. <br>
    The reason behind this decision is that every endpoint ALWAYS return what is expected or, <br>
    as per specification, an appropriate error. We decided to avoid big request with large amount of <br>
    data and informations to adhere to the principle that simple is, not always but often, better. <br>
    So for example if /books/?isBestSeller={value} is called, the API user know that it will always produce <br>
    an array of books, or an array of error/status and he can check (and should definitely do it) the content of the response beforehand just by looking at the response code. <br>
    Thus, using a more elaborated model based on jsonObject containing jsonProperty and JsonArray (like twitter API for example),<br>
    was not needed and in general it would have been an overkill. <br>
</p>

<h3><a id="Data_model_32"></a>Data model</h3>

<img src="../assets/images/IDM-Tables.jpg" width="906.75" height="915" />
<p><b>How these map to the OpenAPI data model?</b></p>
<p>Through a middleware (knex) we create JSON files based on the database content. <br>
    This JSON files will be the ones that the open API wil send to the client<br><br><br></p>

<h2><a id="Implementation_35"></a>Implementation</h2>

<h3><a id="Tools_used_36"></a>Tools used</h3>

  <p>Describe here which tools, languages and frameworks did you use for the backend<br>
    of the application.</p>
<ul>
    <ul title="Backend principal tools">
        <li>node.js 8.9.4 - asynchronous framework for the backend code </li>
        <li>npm.js 5.6.0 - Node official packet manager</li>
        <li>express.js - Node famous middleware</li>
        <li>passport.js - widely used authentication and session manager library</li>
        <li>knex.js - database management middleware for Postgres</li>
        <li>Postgres 11.1 - DBMS</li>
        <li> Javascript</li>
        <li>Heroku</li>
        <li>Postman</li>
    </ul>


</ul>
<h3><a id="Discussion_39"></a>Discussion</h3>

<p>Describe here:</p><br>
<ul>
    <li>How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided OpenAPI<br>
        specification?<br><br>
        We tested our API using POSTMAN<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to partition<br><br>
        the web application (static assets vs. application data) <br>
        Our webapp dynamic assets are sent via Json using the provided API. The frontend <br>
        of the application was developed as a module that was integrated after with the backend. <br>
        Ideally, it would be possible to develop a totally different presentation layer,<br>
        for example a mobile app, and integrate it with the provided API.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe synthetically why and how did you manage session state, what are the<br>
        state change triggering actions (e.g., POST to login etc…).<br><br>

        There are 3 state change REST call being:
        <ul>
            <li>/login</li>
            <li>/register</li>
            <li>/logout</li>
        </ul>
        Session persistence is obtained using a cookie provided to the client after login.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Which technology did you use (relational or a no-SQL database) for managing<br>
        the data model? <br><br>
        We used a Postgres SQL database , the choice was dictated by our familiarity with<br>
        heroku PaaS features.
    </li>
</ul>

<br><br><br>



<h3><a id="Task_assignment_50"></a>Task assignment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Alessandro worked principally on Front end part (HTML Page creation, CSS specification and some JS files)</li>
    <li>Sergio worked principally on the development of the backend and API</li>
    <li>Federico worked both in Front End and Back part (ajax request to server, router path creation, some css modification, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="Analysis_of_existing_API_55"></a>Analysis of existing API</h3>
<p>Describe here if you have found relevant APIs that have inspired the OpenAPI<br>
    specification and why (at least two).</p>
Our API was inspired by:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/tree/master/examples/v2.0/yaml">Swagger 2.0 example OpenAPI</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://hackernoon.com/restful-api-designing-guidelines-the-best-practices-60e1d954e7c9">API design guidelines</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/developer/">Instagram API</a></li>
</ul>
We tried to find a balance between using good practices and "common sense". <br>
We learned that there's no "recipe" for a perfect API and in general the consensus <br>
shared by developers is that what really make an API intuitive and easy to use is <br>
the capacity to adapt the good practises to the needed application during development and<br>
most of all writing a good documentation.

<h3><a id="Learning_outcome_58"></a>Learning outcome</h3>
<p>What was the most important thing all the members have learned while developing<br>
    this part of the project, what questions remained unanswered, how you will use<br>
    what you’ve learned in your everyday life?<br>
    Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sergio - I learned how to write an API and its documentation and<br>
        how to manage a secure connection using cookies. Was really interesting <br>
        to learn how javascript callbacks and promises logic work and sure it something<br>
        that i would love to master. I've used the skills developed on an IoT university project <br>
        to write an API for an ESP8266 microcontroller and an MQTT server.
    </li>
    <li>Federico - I learned how to fetch data from an API and render it on the frontend <br>
        side of the application using Ajax. In the past i had worked at the design of HTML pages.<br>
        In the future i would like to learn more about backend development.<br>
    </li>Alessandro - I learned how to design and style HTML pages with CSS and javascript. I learned<br>
         the basic of nodejs and i'm planning to use it for a side project in the future<br>
    
</ul>
